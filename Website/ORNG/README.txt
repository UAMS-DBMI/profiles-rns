We include the precompiled version of the ORNG server (based on Shindig) for your convenience. 

If you want to build this for scratch, you are welcome to do so.  You will need Java and a Maven installed to perform the build.

The source code can be found at https://github.com/CTSIatUCSF/shindigorng.
